* Ensure compatibility with many models by validating against an [open analytics taxonomy](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy)
* Build reusable models with [Pandas-like modeling](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling) that runs on the full dataset
* Chain together custom & [pre-built models](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/open-model-hub) to answer in-depth questions quickly
