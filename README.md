### Open-source infrastructure for product analytics

* Collect model-ready user behavior data and feed it straight into your data warehouse
* Use pandas-like operations and pre-built models that run on the full SQL dataset
* Instantly convert models to SQL to feed all data consumers from a single source of truth

Objectiv is self-hosted, 100% free to use and fully open source.

### Getting Started

Follow our step-by-step [Quickstart Guide](https://objectiv.io/docs/home/quickstart-guide) to set up a fully functional dockerized demo pipeline in under 5 minutes.

| _hi_ |

Our proposal for [a common way to collect & structure analytics data](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy). Describes classes for common user interactions and their contexts. 

* Used as an instrument of validation by Objectiv's Tracker SDK
* Designed to ensure collected data is model-ready without cleaning, transformation or tracking plans
* Enables models to be shared and reused as a result of consistent data collection

Supports a wide range of product analytics use cases. We're currently working on extending the range of marketing related use cases.

### Tracking SDK

Supports front-end engineers to [implement tracking instrumentation](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/tracking) that embraces the open analytics taxonomy.

* Provides guidance and validation to help setting up error-free instrumentation
* Support for React, React Native, Angular and Browser
 
### Open model hub

A [growing collection of pre-built models](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling/models) that you run, combine or customize to quickly build in-depth analyses.

* All models work with any dataset that embraces the open analytics taxonomy
* Currently covers a handful of common product analytics operations
* More advanced models coming soon (i.e. impact attribution of product features on conversion)

### Bach modeling library

Python-based [modeling library](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling/bach) that enables using pandas-like operations on the full SQL dataset

* Includes optimized operations for datasets that embrace the open analytics taxonomy
* Pandas-compatible: Use popular pandas ML libraries in your models
* Output your entire model to SQL with a single command
