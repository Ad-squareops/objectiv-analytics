Objectiv data as it's stored in an sql data base can be analyzed in a Jupyter notebook with the open model
hub. The open model hub is a growing collection of open-source, free to use data models that you can take,
chain and run to quickly build highly specific model stacks for product analysis and exploration. It includes
models for a wide range of typical product analytics use cases.

See the example notebooks section to get started immediately, or check out the full open model hub api
reference.

The open model hub is powered by Bach: Objectiv's data modeling library. With Bach, you can compose models with
familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables
models to run on the full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command. Head over to the
Bach section to learn all about it.
