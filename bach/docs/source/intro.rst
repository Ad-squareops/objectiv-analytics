Introduction

Objectiv data as it's stored in an sql data base can be analyzed in a python environment using the libraries
specifically created for these purpose: the Bach and the model hub.

Bach
~~~~
Bach is Objectiv's data modeling library. With Bach, you can compose models with familiar Pandas-like
dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the
full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command.

Model hub
~~~~~~~~~
The model hub contains a growing collection of open-source, free to use data models that you can take, chain
and run to quickly build highly specific model stacks for product analysis and exploration. It includes models
for a wide range of typical product analytics use cases.

The model hub is a great starting point for analyzing Objectiv data. See the "Objectiv analysis & modeling
examples" section to get started, or learn about more advanced features of the model hub in conjunction with
Bach.
