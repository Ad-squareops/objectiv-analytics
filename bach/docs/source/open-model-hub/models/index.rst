Models
======

The open model hub is  toolkit that contains functions and models that can be applied on data collected
with Objectivâ€™s Tracker. There are three types of functions/models:
1. :ref:`Map <models_reference_mapping>` functions. These helper functions simplify manipulating and analyzing
the data tracked by Objectiv's tracker.
2. :ref:`Aggregate <models_reference_aggregation>` models. These models consist of a combination of Bach
instructions that run some of the more common data analyses or product analytics metrics.
3. Machine learning models that can be used with Bach data.



Map
---
Map functions always return a series with the same shape and index as the
:class:`DataFrame <bach.DataFrame>` they are applied to. This ensures they can be added as a column to that DataFrame. Map
functions that return :class:`SeriesBoolean <bach.SeriesBoolean>` can be used to filter the data.

Aggregate
---------
Aggregate models perform multiple Bach instructions that run some of the more common data analyses or
product analytics metrics. Always return aggregated data in some form from the
:class:`DataFrame <bach.DataFrame>` the model is applied to.

Machine Learning
----------------

Currently we support  :ref:`logistic regression <modelhub_reference_logistic_regression>` directly on Bach DataFrames and Series.
