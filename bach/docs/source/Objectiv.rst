Objectiv Bach Open Taxonomy
===========================

.. currentmodule:: bach_open_taxonomy

Objectiv data as it's stored in an sql data base can be analyzed in a python environment using the libraries
specifically created for these purpose: the Bach and the model hub.

- With Bach, the data can be analyzed using a pandas inspired interface.
- With the model hub, most standard product analytics models can be performed on the data without much
  configuration. In the background it runs on Bach, but in most cases models can be run with just a single line
  of code.
