Objectiv analysis & modeling examples
=====================================

Here are several examples of how you can analyze and model data using Objectiv. For data collected by the
Objectiv tracker, head over to `Getting started with Objectiv data
<getting_started.html>`_. In this section you will create a Bach DataFrame with Objectiv data. The model hub
uses this DataFrame for its models.

For doing pandas operations on your Objectiv Frame we use the Bach modeling library. This can also be used
for any other database table. For a general introduction to Bach, head over to `Bach basics
<bach_basics.html>`_.
