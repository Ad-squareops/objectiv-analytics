Below are some examples of how you can analyze and model data using Objectiv. For data collected by the
Objectiv tracker, head over to `Getting started with Objectiv data
<getting_started.html>`_. Objectiv tracked data can be analyzed using Objectiv Frames. Objectiv Frames load
point to the data in the sql data base and all operations are done on this object and performed directly on
the data in the data base. You can analyze data with Objectiv Frames using pandas-like syntax or use
ready-made models from the model hub to apply on your data set.

For doing pandas operations on your Objectiv Frame we use the Bach modeling library. This can also be used
for any other database table. For a general introduction to Bach, head over to `Bach basics
<bach_basics.html>`_.
