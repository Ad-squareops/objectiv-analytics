# Example Notebooks
This directory contains notebooks to demonstrate the use of Bach and ModelHub. They can be used as a 
starting point for your own analyses as well.

## Setup
Please see the ModelHub [README.md](../modelhub/README.md) to set up your environment. After that, execute 
the commands below in the same `venv` as where you did the ModelHub install. 

Now it should be as simple as:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt # install notebook specific requirements
jupyter-notebook [any notebook from this directory]
```

### Metabase
In order to use the Metabase integration in some of the example notebooks, make sure to also read the 
Metabase section in the modelhub [README.md](../modelhub/README.md).

## Notebooks 
Please see the most complete list of examples at [the modelhub example page on Objectiv.io](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling/example_notebooks) 
or have a look at the files in this directory; most of them have a pretty decent introduction.
