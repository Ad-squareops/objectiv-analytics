Bach is Objectiv’s data modeling library. With Bach, you can use familiar Pandas-like DataFrame operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction layer that enables models to run on the full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command.\n",

    "# Using the open model hub\n",
    "The ModelHub contains a growing collection of open-source, free to use data models that you can take, chain and run to quickly build highly specific model stacks for product analysis and exploration. It includes models for a wide range of typical product analytics use cases. The source is available for all models and you're free to make any changes to them. \n",

    "\n",
    "The model hub has two main type of functions: `map` and `aggregate`. \n",
    "* `map` functions always return a series with the same shape and index as the Objectiv Frame they originate from. This ensures they can be added as a column to that Objectiv Frame.\n",
    "* `aggregate` fuctions return aggregated data in some form from the Objectiv Frame. Can also be accessed with `agg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally the Objectiv Frame can be filtered with the `filter` method. `map` functions that return SeriesBoolean can be used with the `filter` method.\n",
